The whole running procedure follows these steps
* step1 : Prepare a ntuple from ggNtuple which only contains leading photon and non overlapped jet.
  - target : Signal / QCD MC and data.
  - Step 1.2 : Apply jet selection.
* step2 : Produce 2D histogram for each interested variables. Which is var - chIso plots to separate signal and sideband region.
